# What is out of distribution detection?

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a technique used in machine learning to
identify when a model is presented with data that is significantly different
from the data it was trained on. This is important because many machine learning
models are only accurate on the data they were trained on, and can produce
unreliable or even dangerous results when applied to out-of-distribution data.

OOD detection can be useful in a variety of contexts, such as identifying
fraudulent transactions in a financial system, detecting objects in an image
that the model was not trained on, or determining whether a given input is part
of the training distribution or not. In general, OOD detection can help ensure
that a machine learning model is only applied to data that it is capable of
accurately handling.
