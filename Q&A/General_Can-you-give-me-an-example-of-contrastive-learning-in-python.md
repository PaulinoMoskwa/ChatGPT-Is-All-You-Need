# Can you give me an example of contrastive learning in python?

Here is a simple example of how a contrastive learning algorithm could be
implemented in PyTorch.

```python 
# Import the necessary PyTorch modules
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Define the contrastive learning model
class ContrastiveLearningModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
    super(ContrastiveLearningModel, self).__init__()

    # Define the model's layers
    self.linear1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
    self.linear2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)

  def forward(self, x1, x2):
    # Compute the hidden representations of the input examples
    h1 = F.relu(self.linear1(x1))
    h2 = F.relu(self.linear1(x2))

    # Compute the similarity between the hidden representations
    similarity = F.cosine_similarity(h1, h2)

    # Compute the contrastive loss
    loss = F.mse_loss(similarity, target)

    return loss

# Define the input size and hidden size
input_size = 512
hidden_size = 256

# Create the contrastive learning model
model = ContrastiveLearningModel(input_size, hidden_size)

# Define the optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

# Train the model on pairs of examples
for i in range(num_iterations):
  # Sample a pair of examples from the dataset
  x1, x2, target = sample_pair_of_examples()

  # Compute the contrastive loss
  loss = model(x1, x2)

  # Optimize the model's parameters
  optimizer.zero_grad()
  loss.backward()
  optimizer.step()

# The final model is a representation of the data
# that encodes the important differences and similarities
# between the examples.
```

This is a very simplified example of how a contrastive learning algorithm might
be implemented in PyTorch, and there are many different variations and
implementations that are possible. The specific details and implementation of a
contrastive learning algorithm will depend on the specific task and data you are
working with.
