# Thank you, ChatGPT ðŸ«¶

This archive contains the bare minimum of information needed to understand
various notions I have encountered here and there while trying to carry out
projects.

Once the repository contains sufficient content, it will be reorganized
properly.

A big thank you to the tremendous work of OpenAI's ChatGPT team, the official
content generation tool for this repo.
